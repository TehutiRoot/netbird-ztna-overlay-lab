# Practical Use Cases

## Law-Enforcement / Cybercrime Operations

- **Remote site access**  
  Enable investigators to reach evidence sources (servers, DVRs, network devices) in remote locations without exposing them on the internet.

- **Joint operations with partners**  
  Grant temporary, tightly scoped access to specific subnets or hosts for external analysts or agencies, then revoke once the case is closed.

## Enterprise / SME

- **Secure administration of branch offices**  
  Replace legacy site‑to‑site VPNs with an identity‑aware overlay that can be managed centrally.

- **Home lab / R&D environments**  
  Safely expose lab resources to selected users for testing and training without weakening the perimeter firewall.

## Freelance / Consulting
