# Documentation – NetBird ZTNA Overlay Lab

This directory contains step‑by‑step documentation for building the lab:

- `setup-guide.md` – full installation guide (OCI VM, Debian, NetBird, pfSense, Cloudflare).
- `architecture.md` – diagrams and explanation of how all components interact.
- `pitfalls.md` – issues encountered when running NetBird on a home server and why the OCI deployment works better.
